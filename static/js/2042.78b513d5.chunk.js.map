In this example, I describe ten use cases for AR with examples of companies that are benefitting from this technology.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>1. Training</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        In many industries, augmented reality is being used to enable trainees to practice job tasks in a safe learning environment.\r\n                        <a href='https://www.pbclinear.com/Blog/2020/December/Advanced-Manufacturing-Augmented-Reality-Training'> PBC Linear</a> is using AR to effectively train operators to perform CNC machine tasks. \r\n                        An operator wearing a HoloLens headset has to complete a sequence of tasks with instructions and videos overlaid onto a machine.\r\n                        This form of learning-by-doing training produces reduced learning times, greater accuracy and better memory retention than traditional methods using manuals.\r\n                        AR is being used to help employees identify risks in the workplace and follow safety procedures in hazardous situations or emergencies.\r\n                        Medical schools are using AR holographic anatomical models to train students in surgical procedures and anatomy.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>2. Automotive industry</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The head-up display (HUD) technology has been in used fighter aircraft for many years and now its found another useful function in cars for navigation and improving safety.\r\n                        Some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHaSnyikRpU'>Mercedes models </a>have a HUD displaying speed,\r\n                        directions and hazard alerts on the windscreen. Having information projected into the driver&apos;s line of\r\n                        sight makes navigation easier, reduces distractions and driver fatigue, and makes for a safer\r\n                        journey. Drivers can also be alerted of hazards such as nearby pedestrians and cyclists,\r\n                        exceeding the speed limit or not keeping a safe distance.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>3. Education</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The possibilities of AR in education are endless, bringing books to life and making the learning\r\n                        experience more engaging, fun, collaborative and memorable. Students can watch as a\r\n                        solar system presentation is displayed right in front of their eyes in 3D with exciting visuals,\r\n                        sounds, and animation. As a child is reading a story, pages can come to life and show an\r\n                        animated story above the page. History students can gather around a 3D model of the earth\r\n                        and discover interesting historical places to view and learn about.\r\n                        <a href='https://quivervision.com/'> Quiver </a>AR workbooks use augmented reality and coloring books to help children learn to develop their writing, spelling and math skills.\r\n                        With the Quiver AR app, the coloured pictures come to life off the page in animated 3D.   \r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h4>4. Logistics</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The <a href='https://www.teamviewer.com/apac/products/frontline/'> TeamViewer xPick</a> AR solution has many features to improve logistic processes.\r\n                        With smart glasses, tasks such as inventory control and picking can be performed hands-free, more accurately and in less time.\r\n                        <a href='https://www.teamviewer.com/en/success-stories/dhl/'> DHL Supply Chain</a> is using it&apos;s xPick solution in warehouses around the world to improve logistic processes.\r\n                        Workers with AR smart glasses receive picking instructions and item locations, allowing them to work more easily and efficiently.\r\n                        During trials, productivity was improved by 15 percent with higher accuracy rates.

AR is also being used for\r\n                        medical students to perform the dissection of virtual cadavers and learn about anatomy.\r\n                        \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>6. E-commerce</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        In e-commerce AR is helping consumers visualize and virtually try on products before\r\n                        purchasing, using their smartphone. A product such as a sofa can be virtually placed in a\r\n                        room to see how it looks and fits. \r\n                        <a href='https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050'> The&nbsp;Ikea Place</a>&nbsp;app can be used by\r\n                        customers to see how furniture looks and fits in their home before buying. \r\n                        Virtual try-on apps allow consumers to try on glasses, shoes or makeup without even visiting a store. \r\n                        <a href='https://modiface.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'> L&#39;Oreal Modiface technology&nbsp;</a>\r\n                        lets consumers try makeup, hair colors and nail products before buying.\r\n                        For many companies, AR is an important marketing tool, especially on social media where it helps connect with customers and raise brand awareness.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>7. Repair and servicing</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Using AR technology on-site technicians can see diagnostic information and troubleshooting guides and instructions in front of them, freeing up their hands for other tasks.\r\n                    Remote assistance with AR gives a technician access to remote help to an expert to resolve issues more quickly. \r\n                    HURCO is using <a href='https://www.teamviewer.com/apac/products/frontline/solutions/xassist/'>TeamViewer Assist AR </a>to provide remote technical assistance for its customers and technicians for inspection, servicing and equipment maintenance.\r\n                    Using AR glasses, on-site technicians can be guided by HURCO experts who can see what the technician sees through the glasses.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>8. Museums</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Museum experiences are being enhanced with AR, bringing exhibits to life with 3D graphics, animations and sound. \r\n                        AR glasses have the potential to revolutionize museum exhibitions with an immersive experience that smartphones lack. \r\n                        At the <a href='https://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/bone-hall'> Smithsonian Museum Bone Hall</a> visitors can use the Skin and Bones AR app to see how the specimens look and moved when they were alive.\r\n                        Many museums have scanned objects into 3D models and made them available online to view in AR. \r\n                        Today students don&apos;t even have to visit a museum to look at ancient artifacts or steam locomotives, they can visit a museum website and view and learn about an object in the home or classroom using AR. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>9. Military</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        The US military has developed a combat AR headset system based on Microsoft HoloLens called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Visual_Augmentation_System'>IVAS</a>.\r\n                        IVAS is designed to train and enhance the capabilities of soldiers on the battlefield, improving tactical decision-making, target acquisition, enemy engagement and situational\r\n                        awareness.
