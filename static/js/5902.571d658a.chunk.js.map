                       Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that combines digital elements with the physical world on devices such as smartphones and smart glasses. \r\n                            In e-commerce, AR helps consumers explore and try out products online without visiting a store.\r\n                            Mixed reality (MR) is an extended version of AR that incorporates aspects of both AR and virtual reality (VR).\r\n                            MR devices can detect the physical environment as planes or 3D objects using the device camera or sensors which allows digital and physical elements to interact.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <h3>Augmented reality benefits consumers</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p> One of the drawbacks of online shopping is the lack of touch and interaction, making it difficult to judge the quality and suitability of an item.\r\n                        AR and 3D technologies aim to narrow the gap between the online and in-store shopping experience, making it possible for consumers to visualize and interact with items online.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Brands using AR make it possible for customers to visualize and interact with their products in real-world locations using a smartphone.\r\n                        This allows a customer to see if a table matches the existing furnishings or if a microwave looks good and fits in a particular place in the kitchen.\r\n                        AR apps can also feature personalization so that a customer can try out various product variations.\r\n                        <a

convenient for consumers shopping online.\r\n                        There are no apps to install or load, simply click a button on a web page and an item can be viewed in AR.\r\n

      <p>\r\n                        Virtual try-on applications are becoming increasingly popular for products such as glasses, shoes, and makeup.\r\n                        An example is <a

before buying.\r\n                        Many AR apps run in the browser and the app can be conveniently launched from a web page.\r\n\r\n                        Using<a href='https://www.vyking.io/'

           <h3>Augmented reality benefits brands</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Consumer reports such as the Snap Global Consumer AR Report demonstrate that AR has significant benefits for brands.\r\n                        Online marketing campaigns with fun and engaging AR filters are being used to improve brand recognition and acquire more customers.\r\n

those without, and with lower costs.\r\n                        AR Filters are highly engaging social media versions of AR that can generate millions of impressions, making them an ideal way to raise brand awareness and get more customers.\r\n                        They&apos;re easy to create and there is a large number to choose from, ranging from face filters to virtual try-on apps.\r\n
